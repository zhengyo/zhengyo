# I'm a Chinese. 
# 我是中国人。🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳

我大部分都用英文，因为英文目前是一个国际通用语言，在一小部分时间我才用中文。
I mostly use English, because English is currently an international language, in a small part 
of the time I only use Chinese.

我现在只会用Python编写程序，以后还要学习更多语言。
I can only write programs in Python now, and I will learn more languages in the future.
